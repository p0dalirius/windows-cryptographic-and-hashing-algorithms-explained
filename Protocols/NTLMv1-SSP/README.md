# NTLMv1 SSP Protocol

The NTLMv1 SSP (Security Support Provider) protocol is an extension of the NTLMv1 authentication protocol. It provides additional security features and support for secure communication between clients and servers in Windows environments.

NTLMv1 SSP enhances the NTLMv1 protocol by incorporating mechanisms for message integrity, confidentiality, and mutual authentication. It ensures that the exchanged messages are not tampered with during transmission and that both parties can verify each other's identities securely.

NTLMv1 SSP is designed to address some of the vulnerabilities present in the basic NTLMv1 protocol, such as pass-the-hash attacks and lack of mutual authentication. By adding these security enhancements, NTLMv1 SSP aims to strengthen the overall security posture of systems using NTLMv1 for authentication.
