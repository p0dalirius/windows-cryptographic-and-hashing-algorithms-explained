# Authentication HTTP NTLM

Authentication HTTP NTLM is a method of authentication used in HTTP protocol that relies on the NTLM (NT LAN Manager) authentication protocol. It allows clients to authenticate with servers using a challenge-response mechanism, where the server sends a challenge to the client, and the client responds with a hashed value based on the challenge and its credentials. This method provides a secure way of authenticating users over HTTP connections.
